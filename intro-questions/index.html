            <li>Alan Moon, Communication Design BFA, Junior</li>
            <li>Have to take this course for my major.</li>
            <li>Did one exercise in Typography 1 where we had to use HTML to 
                format a chapbook.</li>
            <li>Hoping to learn to understand HTML better.</li>
            <li>Have to think about the way the user interacts with the screen with their mouse, 
                eyes, and keyboard and how those inputs change the way we design.</li>

                This design portfolio is really well done and shows the 
                designer's unique approach to a website but when you scroll down it shows the projects that they
                have worked on in a concise and visually appealing way.</li>

                This website is very straightforward once creating an account and 
                most people can easily understand the function of it and how to take advantage of the service.</li>
            <li><a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank">https://stripe.com</a>
                This is a website that I think combines both functionality and aesthetic really well without one being 
                overpowering to the other.</li>
